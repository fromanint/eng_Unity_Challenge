## Other

1. Voices were made with Revoicer AI to sound more realistic.
2. 3D models were found on different platforms such as the Unity Asset Store, TurboSquid, and others.
3. Images were generated by DALL-E, but the buttons and individual elements were extracted with Photoshop and GIMP.
4. Scripts were generated from scratch, and only a few lines were found on the internet.
5. This project uses TextMeshPro, so install the package if you haven't already.
6. Remember, AppManager will never be destroyed throughout the game, so you can use it to store variables across scenes.
